# conformal-prediction-for-ordinary-kriging

All these files are used in the paper "Conformal prediction for functional Ordinary kriging".
This paper is uploaded to arXiv with doi https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.20084.
The file "function.R" is the file with all the functions used.
The file "simulation.R" is the file with the simulation study.
In the file "performance_index.R" we compute the indices to evaluate the performance of the conformal prediction.
In the file "example.R" we make an example of a conformal prediction used with ordinary kriging on a real dataset.
